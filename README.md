"Bach ke" is a multi platform one player game. It is available on Google play under the title "BACH KE".
 
Idea :
 
Every device screen has a boundary surrounding it. If we visualize, it can be seen as walls for the objects inside it. 
In this game's context, Top edge can lead to sky if we go up and as we move down, it can be viewed as something coming towards ground or earth's surface.
 
What is thought as the game play is :
 
A ball is made to fall from the sky and brought inside the "defined" boundaries of the screen. The ball falls towards the Earth's surface, which is nothing but wave (Ocean in this context). 
 
What is expected from the player is to prevent ball to touch the wave.
 
The way he/she could do is that he/she can deflect the ball to take some other path so that it doesn't touch the wave.
 
Once the user identifies where the ball will fall, he/she can just touch at that position, which generates a bigger ball at that position, making both the balls to collide. The bigger ball having higher mass, makes the falling ball to deflect and take another path. 
 
To make things interesting, the walls on the sides are made elastic, whch means the ball will gain energy on every collision with the walls. 
 
So, save from wave is the core concept behind the game. Stay in the game for maximum time to gain maximum score.
 
Below, is the landing page of the app, which shows player how to play and a start and a history bubble. All the bubbles float inside the screen boundary.


The UI of the game is built keeping kids in mind, as they like more dynamic stuffs and get fascinated by changing or moving things. All the bubbles gets different colors every time and they move inside the screen area with different speed. The colors are very random and they complement to the text color too.
